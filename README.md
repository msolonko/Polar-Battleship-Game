This is a remake of the classic battleship game using polar coordinates. It is useful as a tool in the classroom to teach the new coordinate system to students in an entertaining way.

The player positions 5 or 10 ships around the map prior to the start of the game. Then, the player and computer take turns attacking. The player also has to identify the coordinate of the computer's attack (to reinforce their understanding of the coordinate system). 

The game can be viewed and played at msolonko.net/battleship
